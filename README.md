# HTML Project with Tailwind CSS

This is a simple project that uses HTML and Tailwind CSS for web interface development.

## Requirements

Before starting the project, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Node.js**: To install and run Tailwind CSS.
- **Live Server**: To open the project in your browser and view changes in real-time.

## How to Run the Project

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, you need to install the project dependencies. Run the following command in the root of the project:

```bash
npm install

### 2.  Run Tailwind CSS

To compile Tailwind CSS and keep it updated, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev

This will compile the output.css file and watch for any changes made to the input.css file.

### 3. Start the Project with Live Server

Open the project using a local server, such as the Live Server extension in VS Code (or any other method you prefer). To do this:

1. Right-click on the ```index.html``` file.
2. Select Open with Live Server.

This will open the project in your default browser, and any changes made to the HTML or CSS will be automatically reflected.
